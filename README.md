# course-2021-fall-phys-3305-classical-mechanics
This course is designed to provide a rigorous understanding of classical dynamics. Concepts covered include the motion of a particle to a system of particles in one, two, and three dimensions; detailed treatment of the conservation laws, rigid body motion, and rotating systems. It introduces students to Lagrange and Hamiltonian dynamics and noninertial reference frames. Prerequisites: PHYS 2426 and MATH 2415.
